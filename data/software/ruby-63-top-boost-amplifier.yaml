details: |-
  The Ruby 63 plug-in gives you the inspiring, album-ready tone of an expertly miked 'golden unit' top boost amp, within seconds. Based on the award-winning UAFX pedal, you get all the controls that make this amp a must-have for recording pop, rock, metal, country, and more.

  Ruby '63 gives you the normal, brilliant, and vibrato channels from the original amp so you can fly to Ireland, London, or Liverpool with the flip of a switch. From mellow to chime to grind, it's all in here, with the unmatched sound and feel of a truly iconic amp.

  Ruby '63 packs emulations of classic boost pedals, right onboard. Namely, we've included the legendary '60s Dallas Rangemaster germanium treble booster and the preamp of a '70s Maestro EP-3 tape delay. Just flip the boost switch for searing layered tones that add even more character to the amp.

  Native plug-ins are supported on macOS and Windows systems. See our native UAD system requirements article for full system requirements. An iLok account is required for managing your native plug-in licenses. We support iLok USB keys for portability, but one is not required.
