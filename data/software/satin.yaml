  Satin is a digital tape simulation plugin that recreates the unique characteristics of analog tape recording, offering musicians and audio engineers a way to add warmth, saturation, and vintage character to digital recordings. It models individual components of tape machines, allowing users to construct their own custom tape unit with unprecedented flexibility.

  The plugin provides comprehensive sound-shaping capabilities, including controls for saturation, transient smoothing, compression, noise modulation, flutter, and hiss. Users can manipulate various tape machine components to generate unique sonic textures, from subtle warmth to extreme effects.

  Satin offers advanced features like a delay panel with 4 reproduction heads, allowing users to create custom tape delay machines with adjustable tape speed, material selection, and feedback. The flange mode emulates classic tape flanging techniques, providing creative sound manipulation options.

  The service panel gives detailed control over esoteric tape characteristics, including hiss, wow & flutter, bias, head gap, azimuth, and high-frequency compression. Users can select from different eq curves and noise reduction encoding models to precisely shape their sound.

  Compatible with major daws and formats including vst3, AU, AAX, and clap, satin is designed for both professional studios and home recording environments, offering native instruments nks compatibility and support for macos, windows, and linux systems.
