description: Play the most expressive, realistic software piano ever made.
  Harness ultraresonance technology for unparalleled realism, dynamic
  sensitivity, and timbral characters. Easily mix between expertly placed close
  and room mics.
details: Ravel gives you the breathtaking sound of a steinway model b grand
  piano.* using ua’s industry-leading physical modeling techniques, ravel goes
  far beyond other piano plug-ins and sample libraries with its unprecedented
  realism, giving you album-ready sonics and inspiring playability. The steinway
  model b is the most recorded studio piano for a reason, delivering the ideal,
  mixable studio grand sound heard on countless modern hits. Its rich tones
  blend perfectly with drums, bass, and electric guitar, giving you a balanced,
  mix-ready piano track every time. Sympathetic string resonance is the achilles
  heel of virtual pianos. Using proprietary modeling and sampling techniques,
  ua’s exclusive ultraresonance technology perfectly captures these complex
  interactions, giving you the airy palette of harmonics so notes melt into each
  other. Sculpt your piano sounds with three pairs of hand-chosen vintage mics.
  Featuring only the controls you need, easily tweak ravel’s volume, tone, and a
  microphone close/room slider, giving you intimate tones to lush room sounds,
  and everywhere in between. Looking to add drama, suspense, or other
  left-of-center timbres? Ravel’s reverse feature gives you unique atmospheric
  piano sounds, letting you add subtle reverse textures to your normal piano
  playing, or go completely “backwards” for all kinds of fun.
