  The pure plate reverb plug-in was engineered by the modeling experts at
  universal audio to be a no-compromise emulation of this classic effect. By
  capturing all of the sonic and mechanical nuances of the steel plate,
  transducers, and dampers, the pure plate reverb plug-in gives vocals, guitars,
  strings, and synths a lush, satisfying space that gently flatters any source.


  Quickly find the perfect ambience whether youre tracking in realtime using an
  apollo interface, or mixing in your DAW, pure plate reverbs intuitive controls
  deliver musical results for beginners and pros alike.


  The baxandall-type bass and treble controls sculpt the timbre of the reverb,
  while the low cut hz input filters and pre delay further season the reverbs
  character. Finally, the balance control lets you place your space perfectly in
  the stereo spectrum.


  No matter the source, pure plate reverb gives you the rich analog dimension
  and depth of an old-school plate reverb system.


  We provide three activations per license. We support activation on your
  computer or on an ilok USB key. For every uad plug-in that supports native and
  apollo/uad-2 versions, you get a license for both upon purchase, or the option
  to get it through an upgrade. Native plug-ins are supported on macos and
  windows systems. See our native uad system requirements article for full
  system requirements. An ilok account is required for managing your native
  plug-in licenses. We support ilok USB keys for portability, but one is not
  required.
