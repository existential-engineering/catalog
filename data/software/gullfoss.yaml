details:
  - Gullfoss is an intelligent equalizer designed for musicians and mastering engineers, offering a clean user interface with basic parameters to improve audio clarity, detail, spatiality, and balance quickly. The tool uses advanced computational analysis to understand competing audible elements and optimize sound perception.
  - The equalizer employs a sophisticated auditory perception model that can make objective decisions about sound, allowing it to fix balancing issues between sound elements without accessing individual tracks. This enables more consistent mix translation across different listening environments.
  - Gullfoss provides precise audio processing capabilities, capable of changing frequency response rapidly without introducing audible artifacts or degrading signal quality. Its intelligent approach allows for quick fixes that would typically require significant time and professional audio engineering experience.
  - 'The software offers two primary auditory model variations: a standard model suitable for live music mixing and tracking with minimal transient treatment, and an extended model tuned for mastering with higher precision and slightly higher cpu consumption.'
  - The plugin represents an innovative approach to audio processing, offering musicians and engineers a tool that can dramatically improve mix clarity and definition with minimal manual intervention.
