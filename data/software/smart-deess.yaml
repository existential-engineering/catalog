details:
  - Smart:deess is a content-aware de-esser plugin that uses advanced ai and neural network technology to analyze and process vocal recordings. It goes beyond traditional de-essing by identifying and processing specific phonemes with unprecedented precision, creating more natural and balanced sound quality.
  - The plugin uses a sophisticated approach to sibilance reduction, identifying individual phoneme types like s, z, sh, ch, t, and p in real time. It determines the exact start and end points of each sibilance without manual threshold setting, processing the entire phoneme rather than just the loudest part.
  - Users can customize the sibilant character using color controls, allowing for soft, balanced, or sharp sound shaping. The plugin can revive dull or lisping sibilants through its advanced spectral processing, providing more nuanced control over vocal audio than traditional de-essers.
  - Smart:deess automatically builds a voiceprint of the input voice signal upon loading, balancing sibilants and plosives with minimal user intervention. The plugin aims to save time by allowing users to focus on achieving the desired sound rather than constantly correcting unwanted audio artifacts.
  - The plugin offers a comprehensive visual interface and supports various vocal processing needs, with particular effectiveness noted for challenging vocal recordings like german vocals. It provides a more intelligent and adaptive approach to de-essing compared to traditional volume-based audio processing tools.
