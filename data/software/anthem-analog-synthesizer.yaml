description: Put the biggest, baddest analog sounds at your fingertips. Sculpt
  enormous bass and powerful leads that fill out your song with fat analog
  texture. Dial in the bold analog-modeled filter, from subtle warmth and
  saturation to all-out sonic destruction. Get unapologetically lo-fi with
  vintage modulation effects, spring reverb, and more.
details: Anthem analog synthesizer is a software synthesizer that offers a range
  of features for creating thick bass, punchy leads, and expressive sequences.
  It is built for sculpting enormous bass and powerful leads that fill out your
  song with fat analog texture. The synthesizer includes a crunchy
  analog-modeled filter, fat oscillators, and lo-fi effects, allowing you to
  make sounds that make statements. Anthem takes inspiration from the most
  coveted mono-synths of bygone eras and goes beyond to create something
  entirely new. With bold, perfectly imperfect analog textures and vibey
  paraphonic chords, you can add energy and emotion to your modern productions.
  The synthesizer offers hundreds of carefully curated presets, enabling you to
  explore album-ready sounds right from the jump or use anthem's intuitive,
  no-nonsense controls to craft your own. Whether you're chasing instant
  inspiration or shaping sounds tailored to your unique style, anthem keeps you
  focused on music, not menus. Anthem's intuitive step sequencer allows you to
  spark grooves, melodies, and rhythms quickly. Whether you need a simple
  8th-note riff, ripping acid bassline, or evolving generative soundscape,
  you'll find instant inspiration. The onboard chorus, flanger, spring reverb,
  and tape echo are modeled from real analog gear and packed with vintage warmth
  and lo-fi character. So whenever you need to dial in some depth, width, or
  dimension, you can find a vibe without pulling up more plug-ins and breaking
  your flow. Anthem gives you analog sound with amazing modern features. From
  smooth pads to edgy leads and punchy bass, anthem has that magic all on its
  own and its sounds are so inspiring, it makes writing easy. The synthesizer is
  a simple yet beautiful software synthesizer that produces clear, delicate
  sounds. This synthesizer is always useful when you need convincing analog
  sounds. Anthem provides three activations per license and supports activation
  on your computer or on an ilok USB key. Native plug-ins are supported on macos
  and windows systems. An ilok account is required for managing your native
  plug-in licenses. We support ilok USB keys for portability, but one is not
  required.
