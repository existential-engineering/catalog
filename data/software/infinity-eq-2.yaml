description: Infinity eq 2 is a flexible, dynamic eq with new filter types, pristine performance, and a streamlined gui.
details: |-
  Infinity eq 2 takes our popular parametric eq to the next level with dynamic filters, three new filter types, and a major gui update. It's the ultimate flexible, transparent equalizer for any audio producer's toolkit.

  Infinity eq 2 brings dynamic filters to the infinity eq, applying transparent compression and expansion to your set curve when the signal crosses the threshold. This creates a more natural, musical mix that lets your sound breathe.

  Infinity eq 2 also features two new timing modes: tight and smooth. Tight is very reactive and great for tasks like de-essing, while smooth offers a slower release that lets more transients through.

  The infinity eq 2 filters have perfect analog-matched shape. They don't introduce distortion up to nyquist frequency.
