details:
  - Fabfilter pro-mb is a versatile multiband dynamics processor that revolutionizes multiband compression and expansion. Unlike traditional multiband tools, it allows users to create bands directly at specific frequency ranges, offering unprecedented flexibility in audio processing. The plugin enables intuitive placement of processing bands anywhere in the spectrum, with the ability to easily snap bands together for traditional crossover configurations.
  - The plugin features multiple processing modes including a unique dynamic phase mode with zero latency and no static phase changes, as well as linear phase and minimum phase modes. Users can fully customize each band with independent controls for threshold, range, attack, release, output gain, ratio, and stereo linking. The plugin supports various dynamics processing techniques from transparent compression to aggressive gating and pumping upward compression.
  - Pro-mb boasts a beautiful retina interface with an interactive multiband display designed for optimal workflow. It includes advanced features like a real-time frequency analyzer, band solo/mute options, precise output metering, and gpu-powered graphics acceleration. The plugin supports extensive parameter control, including MIDI learn, a/b comparison, and sample-accurate automation of all parameters.
  - The plugin is available in multiple formats including VST, vst3, audio units, clap, AAX native, and audiosuite for both windows and macos. It supports 64-bit and 32-bit hosts, with compatibility for windows 11/10/8/7 and macos 10.13 or higher, including support for apple silicon and intel processors.
  - Pro-mb offers comprehensive audio processing capabilities with up to six freely placeable processing bands, allowing for extremely precise and flexible multiband dynamics control. Its intelligent, program- and frequency-dependent attack and release curves provide musicians and audio engineers with powerful tools for sophisticated sound shaping.
