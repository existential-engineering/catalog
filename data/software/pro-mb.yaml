details:
  - FabFilter Pro-MB is a versatile multiband dynamics processor that
    revolutionizes multiband compression and expansion. Unlike traditional
    multiband tools, it allows users to create bands directly at specific
    frequency ranges, offering unprecedented flexibility in audio processing.
    The plugin enables intuitive placement of processing bands anywhere in the
    spectrum, with the ability to easily snap bands together for traditional
    crossover configurations.
  - The plugin features multiple processing modes including a unique dynamic
    phase mode with zero latency and no static phase changes, as well as linear
    phase and minimum phase modes. Users can fully customize each band with
    independent controls for threshold, range, attack, release, output gain,
    ratio, and stereo linking. The plugin supports various dynamics processing
    techniques from transparent compression to aggressive gating and pumping
    upward compression.
  - Pro-MB boasts a beautiful retina interface with an interactive multiband
    display designed for optimal workflow. It includes advanced features like a
    real-time frequency analyzer, band solo/mute options, precise output
    metering, and GPU-powered graphics acceleration. The plugin supports
    extensive parameter control, including MIDI learn, A/B comparison, and
    sample-accurate automation of all parameters.
  - The plugin is available in multiple formats including VST, VST3, Audio
    Units, CLAP, AAX Native, and AudioSuite for both Windows and macOS. It
    supports 64-bit and 32-bit hosts, with compatibility for Windows 11/10/8/7
    and macOS 10.13 or higher, including support for Apple Silicon and Intel
    processors.
  - Pro-MB offers comprehensive audio processing capabilities with up to six
    freely placeable processing bands, allowing for extremely precise and
    flexible multiband dynamics control. Its intelligent, program- and
    frequency-dependent attack and release curves provide musicians and audio
    engineers with powerful tools for sophisticated sound shaping.
