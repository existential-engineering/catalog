  Dream Sequence is a programmable rhythm and octave pedal that uses sequencing, envelope shaping, and pitch shifting to create synth-like arpeggios, pulsating sheets of sub-octave distortion, shimmering, ethereal chord washes, and a limitless number of other new sounds.

  The pedal features octave-up and octave-down pitch shifting, a pattern sequencer with rhythmic gating, and tap tempo for syncing to your performance. The digitally-controlled analog drive and tone section adds warmth and character while maintaining an analog dry path for signal integrity.

  Dream Sequence includes an infinite hold sampler that captures and sustains your input, 24 built-in presets, and the ability to save custom presets. The pattern recorder lets you create and store custom sequences for unique rhythmic textures.

  Full MIDI implementation with in/out connections allows for external sync and control, while the expression pedal input enables real-time parameter manipulation during performance.
