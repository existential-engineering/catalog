  Dream sequence is a programmable rhythm and octave pedal that uses sequencing, envelope shaping, and pitch shifting to create synth-like arpeggios, pulsating sheets of sub-octave distortion, shimmering, ethereal chord washes, and a limitless number of other new sounds.

  Microcosm's 11 groundbreaking effects (with a total of 44 preset variations) allow you to slice, stretch, rearrange, and manipulate your playing in musical ways.

  Tweak the sound further using microcosm's built-in pitch modulation, lush stereo reverb (with 4 selectable modes), and resonant lowpass filter.

  When you've found a sound you like, the built-in stereo phrase looper can capture up to 60 seconds of your performance and even allows for layering phrases from different effects.

  All loops, overdubs, and settings can be saved and recalled later using the pedal's 16 user presets.
