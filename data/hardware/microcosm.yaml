description: Microcosm reinterprets your sound in exciting ways using various
  granular sampling, delay, pitch-shifting and micro-looping techniques. Create
  ambient, glitch, and other wild sounds with your guitar, synthesizer, or other
  instrument. Features include stereo in/out, MIDI sync, tap tempo, hold
  sampler, and built-in looper.
details: >-
  Microcosm is a granular effects pedal that rearranges and reinterprets your
  sound in new and exciting ways using a variety of sampling, pitch-shifting,
  delay, and looping techniques. Cascading micro-loops can be locked into tight,
  tap-tempo synced rhythms, diffused into glacial ambient textures, woven into
  hypnotic drones, and much more.


  Microcosm's 11 groundbreaking effects (with a total of 44 preset variations)
  allow you to slice, stretch, rearrange, and manipulate your playing in musical
  ways. Tweak the sound further using microcosm's built-in pitch modulation,
  lush stereo reverb (with 4 selectable modes), and resonant lowpass filter.


  When you've found a sound you like, the built-in stereo phrase looper can
  capture up to 60 seconds of your performance and even allows for layering
  phrases from different effects. All loops, overdubs, and settings can be saved
  and recalled later using the pedal's 16 user presets.


  The micro loop bank has 3 effects, each with 4 preset variations: mosaic -
  overlapping loops play back at different speeds. Seq - looping samples are
  rearranged into new rhythmic sequences. Glide - short overlapping loops shift
  in pitch over time.


  The granules bank has 3 effects, each with 4 preset variations: haze -
  clusters of micro-loops create an immediate wash of sound. Tunnel - cyclical
  micro-loops generate hypnotic drones with unique modifiers. Strum - rhythmic
  chains of recent note onsets create pointillistic textures.


  The glitch bank has 3 effects, each with 4 preset variations: blocks -
  incoming audio triggers predictable glitches and bursts of notes. Interrupt -
  glitches interrupt dry signal with pitch shifted bursts, micro-montages, and
  other unique modifiers. Arp - sequenced runs of samples create arpeggios.


  The multidelay bank has 2 effects, each with 4 preset variations: pattern -
  delay taps are arranged into four different rhythmic patterns. Warp - delay
  taps are manipulated using filters and pitch shifting to create spacious
  textural effects.


  Alternate between forward and reverse effect playback in real time with the
  press of a button. Set the depth and rate of pitch modulation to go from
  subtle vibrato to extreme warble. Add space with an expansive stereo reverb. 4
  reverb styles, ranging from room reverb to massive ambient wash.


  The synth-style resonant lowpass filter allows for dramatic tone sculpting.
  Record and layer performances with the built-in phrase looper and save them
  for later.


  Route the looper before or after the effects, capture rapid-fire loops with
  one tap of a footswitch, record layers of time-synced effects, or even use the
  looper completely independent of the effects bank. Infinite overdubbing +
  reverse loop playback + fade loops in/out + undo/erase. Freezes the effect in
  its current state and sustains it indefinitely until released. Playing on top
  of these sustained tones opens up new melodic possibilities.


  Control the internal clock using the on board tap tempo, MIDI, or the manual
  tempo control. Save your favorite effects, settings, configurations, and
  recorded loops for recall later.
