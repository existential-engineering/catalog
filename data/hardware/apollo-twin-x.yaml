  I love the sound of my twin, and the sound of the plugins, especially the many
  wonderful compressors. However I have to deal with problems everyday. The new
  macs have become rather dark. Great ad/da conversion, excellent headphone and
  microphone preamps. New features are easy to use and extremely useful. At
  first, I was torn, fearing it might be an excessive expense. But as soon as I
  tried it, I knew I was right to get it! The sound quality is amazing, and my
  home studio's performance has improved exponentially. I can't live without it
  now! Carefully consider the number and type of inputs and outputs you need, as
  well as how much real-time uad-2 apollo plug-in processing you think you might
  need. All apollo x models also include a talkback microphone. You can consider
  a USB apollo if you have a windows pc without an available thunderbolt 3 or 4
  port. The apollo x6 supports up to 5.1, apollo x8 / x8p support up to 7.1, and
  apollo x16 / x16d support dolby atmos immersive audio, up to 9.1.6. A
  thunderbolt twin x or x4 can be added to the monitoring system to remotely
  control the volume of the rack apollo. Yes, you can combine up to four
  thunderbolt apollos, one of which can be a desktop apollo such as the twin x
  or x4. Onboard dsp processing allows you to run realtime uad plug-ins with
  near-zero latency. A duo core system has twice the amount of processing power
  compared to a solo core system. You can combine thunderbolt satellites with
  apollos, up to the maximum of six thunderbolt uad-2 devices. Note that
  satellites provide dsp to run uad-2 plug-ins in your DAW, but do not provide
  additional realtime dsp for apollo and uad console. *requires soundid
