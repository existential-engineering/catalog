  Be careful what you wish for—we know you’ve had wet fantasies about
  a no-compromise, dual-cpu boosted and fully rebuilt sequencer, sampler, and
  performance instrument, based on the much-loved workflow of the OP–Z. Now
  including built-in cv, effect sends, and a best-in-class DAC. With 8
  individual instrument tracks and 8 auxiliary tracks for controlling any
  external synthesizer, modular or otherwise, and adding effects. We dare to say
  it's probably the most complete, portable sequencer ever built. iIt's here.
  iIt's real. It's black.


  And it's got so much more than you've wished for.
