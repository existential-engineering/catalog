description: Add vintage analog shimmer straight from 1976. Give instruments 3d
  movement with legendary analog chorus. Add thickness and shimmer to vocals,
  drums, pianos, and more. Create subtle detuned textures or all out warble with
  unmatched vibrato circuit. Get legendary, milkshake-thick chorus on electric
  guitar and bass tracks.
details: The brigade chorus plugin emulates every inch of the legendary boss ce1
  chorus ensemble* pedal introduced in 1976, giving you rich analog chorus and
  chewy vibrato that flatters your guitars, vocals, and synths with luxuriant,
  dreamy textures. Gently enhance or excite your tones and paint sounds with
  milkshake-thick chorus, thanks to a complete emulation of the original analog
  bucket-brigade design made famous by everyone from rush and the cure to herbie
  hancock and the red hot chili peppers. From sea-sick to subtle, get warm
  modulation effects and transform your guitar parts into ear-catching gems,
  from faux rotating speaker effects to gentle detuning. By perfectly capturing
  the vintage ce-1’s coveted analog preamp, you’ll add volume and texture to not
  just your modulation effects, but to your overall tone, for more sustain and
  punch. Built for years of hassle-free performance, brigade chorus & vibrato
  features true/buffer bypass and preamp off/on switches, plus all the analog
  magic of the vintage effect in a slick, compact pedal.
specs: Full-sized uafx pedals (with two footswitches) require 400 ma (milliamps)

  (milliamps) of current
