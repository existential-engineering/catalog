  Apollo E1x lets you add remote-controllable Unison mic/line preamps to your Apollo X16D interface, putting legendary preamp sounds from API, Neve, Manley, SSL, and more on stage, at front-of-house, or in your multi-room studio using Dante networked audio.

  Apollo E1x can be used as a remote-controllable mic/line preamp over any Dante network without an Apollo X16D interface, ideal for expanding your inputs from additional stage rack connections to front-of-house measurement mics to a tamper-proof lectern preamp no matter what Dante-enabled device you use.

  Need more mic pres? No problem. Use the included coupling bracket and threaded mic stand mount to connect multiple Apollo E1x preamps securely, giving you a clean, organized setup anywhere.

  Unlock a complete I/O solution for your Dante network by pairing with Apollo E2M personal monitoring and Apollo X16D audio interfaces. This system gives you UAD realtime low-latency audio processing with personal cue monitoring and the iconic tone of classic mic preamps.
