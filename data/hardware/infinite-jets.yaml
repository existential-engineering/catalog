description: Infinite jets resynthesizes individual notes/chords into new sounds
  using two independent sampling channels. 10 unique presets can be manipulated
  by its internal lfo, envelope shaping, analog drive, and expression controls.
  Create infinite sustain, ambient washes, abrupt glitch, and unique delay
  effects with one guitar pedal.
details: "Infinite jets is a multi-voice synth pedal that resynthesizes
  individual notes/chords into new sounds using two independent sampling
  channels. It offers 4 separate sampling effects in one: blur, synth, glitch,
  and swell. Create lush ambient textures that seamlessly fade from one chord to
  the next, infinite sustain, glitching granular loops, filtered synthesizer
  sounds, violin-like fuzz and swell effects, drones, distorted delay and
  vibrato, and much more. Microcosm's 11 groundbreaking effects (with a total of
  44 preset variations) allow you to slice, stretch, rearrange, and manipulate
  your playing in musical ways. Tweak the sound further using microcosm's
  built-in pitch modulation, lush stereo reverb (with 4 selectable modes), and
  resonant lowpass filter. When you’ve found a sound you like, the built-in
  stereo phrase looper can capture up to 60 seconds of your performance and even
  allows for layering phrases from different effects. All loops, overdubs, and
  settings can be saved and recalled later using the pedal’s 16 user presets.
  The pedal uses two channels of sampling (a & b) to sustain notes indefinitely.
  They can be triggered by your playing automatically or via footswitches.
  Because there are two channels of sampling, notes can attack, sustain, and
  decay on top of each other. This allows for unique harmony, drone, and
  textural effects. Alternate between forward and reverse effect playback in
  real time with the press of a button. Add space with an expansive stereo
  reverb. 4 reverb styles, ranging from room reverb to massive ambient wash. Set
  the depth and rate of pitch modulation to go from subtle vibrato to extreme
  warble. The synth-style resonant lowpass filter allows for dramatic tone
  sculpting. Record and layer performances with the built-in phrase looper and
  save them for later. Route the looper before or after the effects, capture
  rapid-fire loops with one tap of a footswitch, record layers of time-synced
  effects, or even use the looper completely independent of the effects bank.
  Infinite overdubbing + reverse loop playback + fade loops in/out + undo/erase.
  Freezes the effect in its current state and sustains it indefinitely until
  released. Playing on top of these sustained tones opens up new melodic
  possibilities."
