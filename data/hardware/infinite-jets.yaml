details: |-
  Infinite Jets is a multi-voice synth pedal that resynthesizes individual notes/chords into new sounds using two independent sampling channels. It offers 4 separate sampling effects in one: Blur, Synth, Glitch, and Swell. Create lush ambient textures that seamlessly fade from one chord to the next, infinite sustain, glitching granular loops, filtered synthesizer sounds, violin-like fuzz and swell effects, drones, distorted delay and vibrato, and much more.

  The pedal uses two channels of sampling (A & B) to sustain notes indefinitely. They can be triggered by your playing automatically or via footswitches. Because there are two channels of sampling, notes can attack, sustain, and decay on top of each other. This allows for unique harmony, drone, and textural effects.

  Alternate between forward and reverse effect playback in real time with the press of a button. The synth-style resonant lowpass filter allows for dramatic tone sculpting, while the internal LFO and envelope generators provide modulation options.

  All 10 presets can be manipulated by the internal LFO, envelope shaping, analog drive, and expression controls. The digitally-controlled analog drive, tone, and dry mix controls preserve signal integrity while adding character.
