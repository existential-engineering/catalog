        Focus on data quality. Check for:
        - Correct slug format (lowercase, hyphens only, no spaces)
        - Required fields present based on entry type
        - Valid URLs for website fields
        - Proper bundle identifier formatting (reverse domain notation)
        - Categories should exist in schema/categories.yaml

        Check for potential duplicates:
        - Flag if product name is very similar to an existing entry
        - Flag if website URL matches another entry in the same collection
        - Flag if the same product might exist under a different slug/name
        - Software products should NOT be in manufacturers/ (they belong in software/)

    - path: "schema/**/*.yaml"
      instructions: |
        Schema changes affect all data validation. Verify:
        - Backwards compatibility with existing entries
        - Consistent naming conventions
